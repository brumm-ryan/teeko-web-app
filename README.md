## What is Teeko?

Teeko is an abstract strategy game with similiarities to Connect-Four.

## How to Play

Each player has 4 pieces. You and your opponent alternate placing each of your pieces on any open spot on the 5 x 5 board.  Once all pieces have been initially been placed on the board you and your oppponenet take turns selecting a piece and moving it to an open adjacent space.  Your goal is to get all 4 of your pieces in a row. This can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.  There is an additional win condition where you position your pieces as the corners of a 3 x 3 box.  Reach one of these win conditions before your opponenet and you will be victorious.  

Also you will be playing against an AI. Best of luck.
